## How to work with it

### For git skill improvement

1. Create a few branch
   - base_tutorial one for all exercises without result (base state, where you can add another exercise to resolve)
   - current_state one for actual status of completion all exercise (you can merge branch above to get actual list of exercise)
   - exercise_name each branch for every exercise (like in real project, so after completion, you can merge to branch with all solution to upgrade the current state)
